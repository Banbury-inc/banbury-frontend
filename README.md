## üåü Overview

Banbury Cloud is a revolutionary platform that transforms how devices interact and share resources in our interconnected world. Going far beyond traditional cloud storage, Banbury creates a powerful mesh network where devices can seamlessly share and leverage each other's capabilities:

- **Distributed Computing**: Share computational resources across devices, enabling distributed processing of complex tasks
- **Resource Pooling**: Combine memory, storage, and processing power from multiple devices to create a powerful unified system
- **AI Model Sharing**: Access and run large language models and AI capabilities across connected devices
- **Universal Storage**: Share and access files seamlessly across your device network
- **Task Distribution**: Automatically distribute and manage workloads across connected devices for optimal performance

Think of Banbury as a digital ecosystem where your devices work together as one unified system, sharing not just files, but any resource or capability they possess.
